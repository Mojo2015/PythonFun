Well, I figure while we're dicking around with python we need the easiest way possible to collab on projects / look at eachothers shit.

Usually the readme will have notes and information on how to compile the program, but for now just pull it and run the simple programs through IDLE.

***For anybody wanting to test these programs***

1. https://www.python.org/downloads/ -- Download and install Python 3.4.2
2. Run the installer with all settings default
3. Paste this link: https://github.com/Mojo2015/PythonFun/archive/master.zip
4. That will download all of our projects, go to any project, right click on it, choose "Edit with Idle". 
5. A window will pop up containing the source code, press f5 and it will run it in a python interpreter (Shell).

Note: Some projects use multiple files, they contain a readme telling you which .py file to start from.
